# Asteroids
IS237 Final Project
The final project for IS-237 will be the design and implementation of a scenario of your interest. The projects can be coded individually or as a team-of-two. 
The objective is to write a substantial code to practice and demonstrate the skills learned during this course. The project could be a game, a simulation, or a 
solution to a problem you wanted to solve. Feel free to choose something that is interesting and motivating to you.

Project Plan
